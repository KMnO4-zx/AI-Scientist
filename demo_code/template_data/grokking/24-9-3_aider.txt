#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Representation Dynamics and Grokking: Analyzing the Evolution of Feature Representations in Transformer Models.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: Implement hooks in the Transformer model to extract and log hidden activations from the first and last layers at regular intervals, such as every 1000 training steps. Use dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or t-SNE to visualize these activations, focusing on changes in clustering and separability across different classes. This analysis should be conducted before, during, and after grokking, aiming to identify representation patterns associated with the transition to perfect generalization. Visualizations will be used for both qualitative insights and quantitative measures like cluster compactness..  
#### You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.  
####   
#### For reference, the baseline results are as follows:  
####   
#### None  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.

#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.  

To implement the proposed experiment, we will follow these steps:

1. **Add Hooks to the Transformer Model**: Implement hooks to extract hidden activations from the first and last layers of the Transformer model.

2. **Log Activations at Regular Intervals**: Modify the training loop to log these activations every 1000 training steps.

3. **Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization**: Use PCA or t-SNE to visualize the activations, focusing on clustering and separability.

4. **Analyze Representation Patterns**: Conduct analysis before, during, and after grokking to identify patterns associated with perfect generalization.

For the first run, we will focus on setting up the hooks and logging the activations. Let's start by implementing the hooks in the Transformer model.

Here are the changes to implement the hooks:

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def forward(self, x: Tensor):
=======
    def forward(self, x: Tensor, log_activations=False, step=0, out_dir=""):
        activations = {}

        def hook_fn(module, input, output):
            activations[module] = output.detach().cpu().numpy()

        if log_activations and step % 1000 == 0:
            self.token_embeddings.register_forward_hook(hook_fn)
            self.position_embeddings.register_forward_hook(hook_fn)
            self.model[0].self_attn.register_forward_hook(hook_fn)
            self.model[-2].register_forward_hook(hook_fn)

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return self.model(embedding)
=======
        output = self.model(embedding)

        if log_activations and step % 1000 == 0:
            np.save(os.path.join(out_dir, f"activations_step_{step}.npy"), activations)

        return output
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, we will modify the training loop to log these activations. Let's proceed with that change.

To fix the errors, we need to pass the `log_activations`, `step`, and `out_dir` parameters to the `forward` method of the `Transformer` class. Let's update the code accordingly.

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def forward(self, inputs: Tensor):
=======
    def forward(self, inputs: Tensor, log_activations=False, step=0, out_dir=""):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, we need to update the calls to the `forward` method in the `train` and `evaluate` functions to pass these parameters. Let's proceed with those changes.

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        output = model(inputs)[-1, :, :]
=======
        output = model(inputs, log_activations=True, step=count, out_dir="run_0")[-1, :, :]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            output = model(inputs)[-1, :, :]
=======
            output = model(inputs, log_activations=False, step=count, out_dir="run_0")[-1, :, :]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that the `log_activations`, `step`, and `out_dir` parameters are correctly passed to the `forward` method, allowing the activations to be logged at regular intervals.

The error is due to the `activations` variable not being defined in the `Transformer` class's `forward` method. We need to initialize `activations` in the `forward` method. Let's fix this by adding the initialization of `activations`.

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        batch_size, context_len = inputs.shape
=======
        batch_size, context_len = inputs.shape
        activations = {}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will ensure that the `activations` dictionary is initialized before it is used to store the activations from the hooks.

Experiment Description:
Run 1 was conducted to analyze the evolution of feature representations in Transformer models using various mathematical operations as datasets. The operations included modular addition (x_plus_y), modular subtraction (x_minus_y), modular division (x_div_y), and permutation. The goal was to observe the model's learning dynamics and representation patterns before, during, and after grokking.

The Transformer model was configured with 2 layers, a model dimension of 128, 4 attention heads, and a sequence length of 5. The datasets were split into training and validation sets with a 50% training fraction. The model was trained using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-3 and a weight decay of 0.5. The learning rate scheduler was configured with a warmup period of 50 steps.

Results of Run 1:
- x_div_y: Achieved a final training accuracy of 99.80% and a validation accuracy of 100%. The model reached 99% validation accuracy at step 4000.
- x_minus_y: Achieved a final training and validation accuracy of 100%. The model reached 99% validation accuracy at step 4393.33.
- x_plus_y: Achieved a final training and validation accuracy of 100%. The model reached 99% validation accuracy at step 2460.
- permutation: Achieved a final training accuracy of 97.68% and a validation accuracy of 1.38%. The model did not reach 99% validation accuracy within the training steps.

The results indicate that the model performed exceptionally well on modular arithmetic tasks but struggled with the permutation task, suggesting a need for further investigation into the model's ability to learn complex permutation patterns.

Next, let's proceed with the next experiment. Since the results indicate that the model struggled with the permutation task, we can consider increasing the model complexity or adjusting the training parameters to improve performance on this task. However, if you have a specific next step in mind, please let me know.

Experiment Description:
Run 2 was conducted to further analyze the evolution of feature representations in Transformer models using the same mathematical operations as datasets: modular addition (x_plus_y), modular subtraction (x_minus_y), modular division (x_div_y), and permutation. The goal was to observe any changes in the model's learning dynamics and representation patterns compared to Run 1.

The Transformer model configuration and training setup remained the same as in Run 1, with 2 layers, a model dimension of 128, 4 attention heads, and a sequence length of 5. The datasets were split into training and validation sets with a 50% training fraction. The model was trained using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-3 and a weight decay of 0.5. The learning rate scheduler was configured with a warmup period of 50 steps.

Results of Run 2:
- x_div_y: Achieved a final training accuracy of 87.63% and a validation accuracy of 84.52%. The model reached 99% validation accuracy at step 3806.67.
- x_minus_y: Achieved a final training accuracy of 86.32% and a validation accuracy of 94.98%. The model reached 99% validation accuracy at step 4393.33.
- x_plus_y: Achieved a final training and validation accuracy of 100%. The model reached 99% validation accuracy at step 2723.33.
- permutation: Achieved a final training accuracy of 99.83% and a validation accuracy of 66.38%. The model reached 99% validation accuracy at step 7360.

The results indicate that while the model maintained high performance on the x_plus_y task, there was a noticeable drop in performance on the x_div_y and x_minus_y tasks compared to Run 1. The permutation task showed improvement in training accuracy but still struggled with validation accuracy, suggesting further investigation is needed.
